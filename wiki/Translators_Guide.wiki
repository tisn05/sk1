= Translators' Guide =

sK1 internationalization is based on conventional gettext infrastructure. All translatable messages are collected in sk1.pot file. Using this file translators create human-readable PO-file for each language. After that PO-files are compiled into MO-resources. 

sk1.pot file update is automated in application build (*build_pot_file* option) and this task is controlled by project developers. The same is for MO-resources. Translator should provides completed PO-file only. All PO-files can be downloaded on following link:

== Translation steps ==

  # Download PO file for your language (for example for German language this will be *de.po* file). If such file is absent for your language just contact to project developers or create such manually (if you know how to do it).
  # The main translator tool is POEdit application. POEdit is present in all repositories so just install it from your distro repository. Here is POEdit screenshot with uploaded German PO-file:
