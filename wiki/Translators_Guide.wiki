= Translators' Guide =

sK1 internationalization is based on conventional gettext infrastructure. All translatable messages are collected in sk1.pot file. Using this file translators create human-readable PO-file for each language. After that PO-files are compiled into MO-resources. 

sk1.pot file update is automated in application build (*build_pot_file* option) and this task is controlled by project developers. The same is for MO-resources. Translator should provides completed PO-file only. All PO-files can be downloaded on following link:

http://sk1.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sk1/trunk/sK1/po/

== Translation steps ==

  # Download PO file for your language (for example, for German this will be *de.po* file). If such file is absent for your language just contact to project developers or create such manually (if you know how to do it).
  # The main translator tool is POEdit application. POEdit is present in all repositories so just install it from your distro repository. Here is POEdit screenshot with uploaded German PO-file: <br> [http://sk1project.org/images/wiki/poedit.png]
  # Translate all messages in PO-file (POEdit interface is easy and intuitive). Also you can check previously translated messages. Sometimes they require correction. 
  # Save translation result and send it to project developers.

*Notes:*
Some messages can contain technical characters at the end like *\n*, *\t* Just leave they as is. The same for multiline messages: just store the same message structure. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact project developers!

== Desktop resource file ==

To translate messages for system menu you need updating sk1.desktop file. This file can be downloaded on following link:

http://sk1.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sk1/trunk/sK1/src/

Just open this file in conventional editor (KWrite, gedit etc.) and you will see which lines you need adding and translating. After translation send this file to project developers.

== Testing translation result ==
The simplest way is compiling and installing sK1 from source code. Use following commands:

*python setup.py bdist-rpm* (for RPM distros: Mandriva, OpenSuSE, Fedora etc.)<br>
*python setup.py bdist-deb*  (For Debian based distros: Ubuntu, Mint etc.)

As a result you will get packages for you system. Please note that sK1 depends on *sk1libs* and *sk1sdk* packages. So they should be compiled also.
