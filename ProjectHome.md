sK1 is an open-source illustration program that can substitute professional proprietary software like Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator. Currently Linux is our main development platform but porting on Win32 and MacOS X desktops has been scheduled. sK1 supports professional publishing features, such as CMYK color, separations, ICC color management and "press-ready" PDF output.
